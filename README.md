### Version 2 - 8/2020 - Present

Adapted the design and structure to be my official UX Engineering portfolio.
Rebuilt JS hover image for description in gallery portion of the one pager.

### Version 1 - 7/2020

A Snap tech assessment - Build a web portfolio in 3 hrs. 

Notes: In reality, it took two hrs because I spent some time designing it and producing the SVG files to prevent long load time and the enlarged bad quality of rasterized images. The one-pager was hand-coded except for the JS gallery, which would have been faster if I had coded it myself (I lost time trying to get it to work with github.io). Note: I used a CSS template for the gallery's interaction.
