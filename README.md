A Snap tech assessment - Build a web portfolio in 3 hrs. In reality, it was two hrs because I spent some time designing it and producing the SVG files to prevent long load time and the enlarged bad quality of rasterized images. The one-pager was hand-coded except for the gallery, which would have been faster if I had coded it myself (I lost time trying to get it to work with github.io). Note: I used a CSS template for the gallery's interaction.
